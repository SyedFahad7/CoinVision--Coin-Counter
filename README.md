# Coin Detection and Value Calculation

This Python project uses OpenCV and CVZone libraries to detect coins from a live video feed, calculate their total value in rupees, and display the result on-screen.

## Features

- Captures video from a camera and applies image processing techniques to detect coins.
- Uses contour detection to identify different coin sizes and calculate their value based on predefined criteria.
- Displays the total value of detected coins in rupees on the screen.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- CVZone

## Installation

  ```
## Usage
Connect a camera or webcam to your computer.

Run the script:
